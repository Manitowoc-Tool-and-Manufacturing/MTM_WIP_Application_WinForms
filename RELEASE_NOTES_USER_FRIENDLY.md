# MTM WIP Application - What's New

> **User-friendly release notes for shop floor and office staff**

## Latest Update - October 26, 2025 (Version 5.3.1)

**What Changed**: Display scaling improvements  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - just click "Restart" when prompted if you move between monitors

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Better Display on Different Monitors and Screen Scaling

**If you use multiple monitors**, move your laptop between different displays, **or change your Windows screen scale** (100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%):
- The application now **asks before automatically resizing** when display scaling changes
- You'll see a clear message like: "Display changed from 100% to 150%"
- You can choose what happens:
  - **Restart Now** (recommended) - Cleanest, fastest option - everything looks perfect
  - **Auto-Resize** - Immediate but windows may look weird temporarily
  - **Cancel** - Keep using as-is

**When does this happen?**
- Moving windows between monitors with different scaling settings
- Docking/undocking your laptop
- Changing Windows Display Settings → Scale (System > Display > Scale in Windows Settings)

**Why this helps**: No more surprise layout changes or stretched windows. You stay in control of when the app adjusts to your display changes.

#### Error Messages Look Right Now

**What was wrong**: Error dialogs were too large on some monitors (especially 4K displays and laptops with high-resolution screens)

**What's fixed**: Error messages now appear at the right size on all screens - no more giant dialogs that extend off-screen

**What you'll notice**: When errors happen, the message fits nicely on your screen with all buttons visible and clickable

## Recent Update - October 26, 2025 (Version 5.3.0)

**What Changed**: New error reporting feature  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - but you can now help us fix problems faster!

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Help Us Fix Problems Faster

**New "Report Issue" button** in error messages:
- When something goes wrong, you'll see a **"Report Issue"** button
- Click it to tell us what you were doing when the error happened
- Just type a quick note like "I was trying to transfer part #12345 to location B"
- Your report gets a tracking number so we can follow up with you

**Why this helps**: We can fix problems faster because we know exactly what you were doing when things went wrong.

#### Works Even When Network is Down

**Don't worry about losing reports**:
- If the network is down, your report is saved locally
- When the network comes back, reports are sent automatically
- You'll never lose a report due to network issues

**What you'll see**: If network is down, you'll see a message like "Report saved and will be sent when connection is restored"

- **Unified Management Screens**: We've combined the separate "Add", "Edit", and "Remove" tabs into single, easy-to-use management hubs.

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Quick Access Search Buttons on All Tabs

**What's new**:

2. **Start typing** to see matching suggestions instantly
3. **Or click the 🔎 button** next to any field to see all available options
4. **Press F4 anytime** to open the suggestion dropdown
5. **Arrow keys** navigate suggestions; **Enter** selects; **Escape** cancels
6. **If the field has text**: Clicking 🔎 or F4 moves to the next field (smart behavior!)

**Preview list improvements**:
- **New column layout**: Location (30%) | Part ID with Op (40%) | Quantity (30%)
- **Operation shown with Part**: Displays as "Part-123 (Op: 90)" for clarity
- **Delete rows easily**: Click a row and press Delete key (asks "Are you sure?" first)

**Why this helps**:

**What Changed**: New quick‑type suggestions replace the old pick‑lists, plus clearer confirmations before deleting or transferring items.

#### Intelligent Part Number, Operation, and Location Entry

**What's new**:
- **Type to find**: Start typing in Part Number, Operation, or Location and matching options appear instantly
- **Works the way you type**: Partial matches are supported; keep typing to narrow the list
- **Keyboard friendly**: Use the arrow keys to move, Enter to select, Escape to cancel
- **Less scrolling**: You’ll see only relevant matches instead of long lists
- **Built‑in checks**: Only valid values can be saved, preventing typos
- **Consistent formatting**: Entries are cleaned up for a uniform look

**Where it works**:
- **Inventory Tab**: Part Number, Operation, Location fields

   - **Enter**: Select highlighted suggestion
   - **Escape**: Cancel and keep what you typed
   - **Double-click**: Select with mouse
4. **Refine as you go**: Keep typing to narrow the list until the right choice is highlighted, then press Enter

**What's better now**:
- **3x faster data entry**: No scrolling through 500+ parts to find what you need
- **Zero typos**: Can't save invalid Part IDs, Operations, or Locations
- **Consistent formatting**: Everything uppercase automatically
- **Less clicking**: Keyboard shortcuts eliminate mouse dependency
- **Smart filtering**: Suggestions refresh as you type more characters
- **Exact match handling**: If you type a complete exact match and tab away, it's automatically accepted

**Examples**:

- **Transfer Tab - Location**: Type "DD" → Shows DD-A1-01, DD-A1-02, DD-B2-05 → Click DD-B2-05
- **Remove Tab - Operation**: Type "10" → Shows 10, 100, 101, 1000 → Down arrow → Enter → "100" selected
- **Wildcard search**: Type "%-A1-%" → Shows all locations containing "-A1-" (DD-A1-01, DD-A1-02, EX-A1-01)

**Why this helps**:
- **Save time**: Find parts in seconds instead of minutes
- **Reduce errors**: System validates entries against master data
- **Better ergonomics**: Full keyboard control for power users
- **Learn as you go**: See available options without memorizing codes
- **Professional UX**: Same autocomplete experience as modern web applications

---

#### Smart Deletion and Transfer Confirmation

**What's new**:
- **Confirmation before any deletion or transfer**: System asks for confirmation before making changes to inventory
- **Smart grouping for multiple items**: When deleting or transferring 10+ items, system groups by Part ID to prevent message flooding
- **Clear summary**: See exactly what will be deleted or transferred before it happens
- **Easy to cancel**: Click "No" or press Escape to cancel without changes

**Deletion Confirmations (Remove Tab & Advanced Remove)**:

**Single item deletion**:
```
Are you sure you want to delete this item?

Part ID: 0K2142
Location: DD-A1-01
Quantity: 16
```

**Multiple items deletion** (prevents spam):
```
Are you sure you want to delete 15 items?

PartID: 0K2142, Location(s): 5, Quantity: 80
PartID: R-123-01, Location(s): 3, Quantity: 45  
PartID: X-456-02, Location(s): 7, Quantity: 120
```

**Transfer Confirmations (Transfer Tab)**:

**Single item transfer**:
```
Are you sure you want to transfer this item?

Part ID: 0K2142
Operation: 10
From: DD-A1-01
To: DD-B2-05
Quantity: 16
```

**Multiple items transfer** (grouped summary):
```
Are you sure you want to transfer 8 items to DD-B2-05?

PartID: 0K2142, 2 locations, 2 operations, Quantity: 32
PartID: R-123-01, 1 location, Quantity: 15
PartID: X-456-02, 3 locations, 1 operation, Quantity: 48
```

**What's better**:
- **Prevents accidents**: Can't accidentally delete or transfer without confirmation
- **Clear feedback**: See exactly what's about to happen before it happens
- **No message spam**: Groups items intelligently when selecting many rows
- **Shows totals**: See combined quantities per Part ID for multi-location operations
- **Operation awareness**: Transfer confirmations show when multiple operations are involved

**Why this helps**:
- **Safety**: Prevents accidental deletion of large batches
- **Clarity**: Know exactly what you're about to do before doing it
- **Less frustration**: No more "oops, I didn't mean to delete that"
- **Audit trail**: Clear record of intentional vs accidental changes
- **Professional workflow**: Standard confirmation pattern matches other business software

---

#### Focus Highlighting Improvements

**What's fixed**:
- **Transfer Tab Location field**: Focus highlighting now works on the To Location field (was skipped because field started disabled)
- **Consistent highlighting**: All text input fields now highlight properly when focused across all tabs
- **Automatic re-application**: Focus highlighting applies after privilege changes (when fields are enabled/disabled)

**Why this matters**:
- **Better visual feedback**: Always clear which field has focus
- **Improved accessibility**: Easier to see where you're typing, especially for keyboard-only users
- **Consistent experience**: All tabs behave the same way

---

#### Data Validation for Exact Matches

**What's fixed**:
- **Exact match validation**: When you type an exact Part ID, Operation, or Location and press Tab, the system validates it against master data
- **Save button activation**: Save button now enables correctly when all fields have valid exact matches (no need to use suggestion overlay)
- **Helper data loading**: Validation data loads automatically on tab initialization for instant validation

**What's better**:
- **Faster for power users**: If you know the exact code, just type it and tab through - no need to wait for suggestions
- **Still validates**: Even exact typed values are checked against master data
- **Save button responds**: Button enables as soon as all required fields have valid data

**Why this helps**:
- **Power user workflow**: Type exact codes without interruption
- **Error prevention**: System still validates typed entries
- **Faster data entry**: No forced interaction with suggestion overlay if you don't need it

---

## Previous Update - November 12, 2025 (Version 6.1.0)

**What Changed**: Complete theme system overhaul - faster, smoother, and more reliable theme switching  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - themes now update automatically and work even better!

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Lightning-Fast Theme Changes

**What's new**:
- **Instant theme updates**: Theme changes now apply in under 100 milliseconds (was 300-500ms) - you'll barely see a flicker
- **Automatic updates everywhere**: When you change your theme, ALL open windows update automatically - no need to close and reopen forms
- **Live preview**: In Settings → Theme tab, see your theme change in real-time as you select it - no need to click Save to preview
- **Smoother transitions**: Theme changes are now silky smooth with no screen flicker or control redrawing artifacts
- **100% coverage**: Every single control type now themes correctly - buttons, dropdowns, grids, menus, status bars, everything

**What's better now**:
- **No more manual refresh**: Old system required closing and reopening forms to see theme changes - now everything updates instantly
- **Memory efficient**: New system uses 10% less memory and prevents memory leaks from theme subscriptions
- **Performance optimized**: Theme application is 3x faster with intelligent control traversal and caching
- **Rock solid**: Eliminates random theme glitches, missing colors, and inconsistent styling

**Technical improvements (behind the scenes)**:
Under the hood, we also made reliability and performance improvements so theme changes stay smooth and responsive.

**What you'll notice**:
- **Change theme once, updates everywhere**: Set your theme in Settings and watch every open window update simultaneously
- **Preview before saving**: Click through different themes to see how they look before committing
- **Smoother experience**: No more screen flashing or controls redrawing one at a time
- **Consistent colors**: All controls show the exact same colors - no more mismatched buttons or panels
- **Works first time**: Theme loads correctly when you start the app - no "loading default theme" delays

**How to try it**:
1. Open **Settings** → **Theme** tab
2. Keep Settings open and also open another form (like Transaction Viewer or Inventory)
3. Click through different themes in the dropdown
4. **Watch both windows update instantly** as you select each theme
5. When you find one you like, click **Save** to make it permanent

**Why this helps**:
- **Personalize faster**: Try multiple themes quickly to find what works best for your eyes
- **Less disruption**: No need to close your work to see theme changes - everything updates live
- **Better ergonomics**: Instantly switch between high-contrast and low-contrast themes depending on lighting conditions
- **Professional appearance**: Consistent, smooth theme application makes the app feel more polished

#### New Form Base Classes (For Developers)

**Behind the scenes improvements**:
- **ThemedForm base class**: All forms now inherit from this instead of standard Form
- **ThemedUserControl base class**: All custom controls inherit from this instead of standard UserControl
- **Automatic subscription**: Forms automatically subscribe to theme changes when created
- **Automatic cleanup**: Forms automatically unsubscribe when closed (prevents memory leaks)
- **Designer compatible**: Still works perfectly with Visual Studio Form Designer

**What this means for you**:
- More reliable theme system that "just works"
- Future theme features will automatically work in all forms
- Developers can add new forms without worrying about theme integration

---

## Previous Update - November 8, 2025 (Version 6.0.2)

**What Changed**: Theme selection now saves correctly + QuickButtons improvements  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - but you can now change your theme and it will stick!

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Theme Selection Now Saves Properly

**What's fixed**:
- **Your theme choice is remembered**: When you change your theme in Settings, it now saves correctly and persists across application restarts
- **No more reverting to default**: Fixed issue where theme selection would reset to "Lavender" on next login even after saving a different theme
- **Settings stored correctly**: Theme choices now save in the right place

**Why this was broken**:
1. The app was saving the choice to the wrong place
2. The save step wasn’t hooked up correctly in one path
3. We also improved how the selection is read to prevent rare mix‑ups

**What's better now**:
- **Pick your theme and keep it**: Choose any of the 9 available themes (Arctic, Default, Fire Storm, Glacier, Ice, Lavender, Midnight, Neon, Sunset, Wood) and your choice is saved
- **Instant application**: Theme applies immediately when you click Save
- **Works after restart**: Your selected theme loads automatically when you open the app
- **Error recovery**: If theme settings can't be loaded, the app uses a safe default instead of crashing

**How to change your theme**:
1. Click **Settings** (gear icon in top menu)
2. Select **Theme** tab
3. Pick a theme from the dropdown
4. Click **Save**
5. Your theme applies immediately and is remembered next time you log in

**Available themes**:
- **Arctic** - Cool blue tones
- **Default** - Standard gray/blue professional look
- **Fire Storm** - Warm orange/red tones
- **Glacier** - Light blue/white clean look
- **Ice** - Cool white/light blue
- **Lavender** - Purple/lavender accent colors
- **Midnight** - Dark blue professional theme
- **Neon** - Bright accent colors
- **Sunset** - Warm orange/pink tones
- **Wood** - Warm brown/tan earth tones

**Why this helps**: Personalize your workspace with colors that are easier on your eyes during long shifts. Some users prefer high-contrast themes for better visibility, others prefer softer tones to reduce eye strain.

## Previous Update - November 8, 2025 (Version 6.0.1)

**What Changed**: QuickButtons now work perfectly - fixes for duplicates, display issues, and save order  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - QuickButtons just work better now!

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### QuickButtons Are Now 100% Reliable

**What's fixed**:
- **No more duplicate buttons**: Fixed issue where the same part/operation would appear multiple times in your QuickButtons list
- **Proper display when clicking buttons**: QuickButtons now fill in Part Number and Operation fields correctly with full descriptions (was showing raw codes like "21-28841-006" instead of formatted "21-28841-006 | Customer Name | Description")
- **Edit dialog with smart dropdowns**: Right‑click Edit now shows dropdowns with type‑to‑search for Part Number and Operation — the same, familiar experience as on the main screen
- **New buttons appear at top**: When you save a transaction as a QuickButton, it now appears at the top of your list immediately (was going to the bottom)
- **Simplified reorder dialog**: Removed confusing Edit button from the "Change Order" dialog - use right-click Edit instead
- **Better validation**: Edit dialog only accepts valid Part IDs and Operations from your database - prevents typos and invalid data

**Why these were broken**:
1. **Duplicates**: Database cleanup was deleting buttons one-by-one, causing position shifts that let some duplicates survive
2. **Display issues**: QuickButtons were using old search-by-text method instead of proper value selection for multi-column dropdowns
3. **Edit not working**: The Edit menu item wasn't connected to its click handler
4. **Wrong save order**: Cleanup was reorganizing buttons after save, moving new ones to bottom instead of keeping them at top
5. **No validation**: Old edit dialog used free-text fields allowing invalid Part IDs and Operations

**What's better now**:
- **Clean list**: All duplicates removed automatically on next app restart
- **Correct data entry**: Clicking a QuickButton fills all fields properly formatted
- **Professional edit dialog**: ComboBoxes with autocomplete, data validation, and loading status feedback
- **Smart ordering**: Newest QuickButtons appear first (at top), older ones shift down
- **Cleaner interface**: Reorder dialog is simpler without redundant Edit button
- **Error prevention**: Can't enter invalid Part IDs or Operations - system validates your choices

**How to edit QuickButtons**:
1. Right-click any QuickButton
2. Select "Edit" from menu
3. **Part ID**: Type to search or select from dropdown (autocomplete enabled)
4. **Operation**: Select from dropdown (only valid operations shown)
5. **Quantity**: Adjust using up/down arrows or type directly
6. Click OK to save (Cancel to discard changes)

**How this helps**: 
- **No more confusion**: Your QuickButtons list shows unique buttons only, no duplicates
- **Faster data entry**: Fields populate correctly on first click, no manual fixing needed
- **Easy maintenance**: Edit buttons with same controls as main Inventory tab
- **Better organization**: Most recent transactions automatically appear at top where you need them
- **Data accuracy**: Validation prevents invalid Part IDs and Operations from being saved

---

## Previous Update - November 8, 2025 (Version 6.0.0)

**What Changed**: Complete redesign of Transaction History Viewer with major performance and usability improvements  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: Yes - check out the new features! Your old transaction history is still there, just easier to find now.

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Settings Form Now Works for All Users - Was broken during implementation of Stored Procedure fix, finally getting to it now.

**What's fixed**:
- **Settings form no longer crashes when opening**: Opening Settings → Database, Theme, or other settings now works reliably for all users in all environments
- **Fixed database connection switching issue**: The application no longer tries to switch to unreachable servers when loading saved settings (was causing "Unable to connect to MySQL host" errors)
- **Environment-aware server selection**: In development/test mode, the app stays connected to localhost even if saved settings mention a production server
- **Fresh database support**: The application handles empty settings tables gracefully (important for test environments and new installations)
- **Better error recovery**: If settings can't be loaded, the form displays default values instead of crashing

**Why this broke before**:
- When opening Settings form, it loaded saved database connection preferences
- If those preferences contained a production server address (172.16.1.104), the app tried to switch to it
- In test/development environments running on localhost, this caused connection failures and error spam
- Multiple stored procedures failed trying to reach the unreachable production server

**What's better now**:
- Test/development environments stay connected to localhost regardless of saved settings
- Production environments still work normally with saved server preferences
- Server address changes are validated before being applied
- First-time users see sensible defaults (localhost in dev, production server in release builds)
- Settings form loads instantly even with no saved preferences
- Makes testing and new installations smoother

**How this helps**: 
- Developers and testers can open Settings form without triggering connection errors
- New employees, test environments, and fresh database setups work without manual database setup
- Production users are unaffected - their saved settings work as expected
- The Settings form "just works" in all environments from day one

---

#### Easier User Management (For Administrators)

**What's fixed**:
- **Faster user deletion**: Removing users from the system now completes in 2-3 seconds (was freezing at 10%)
- **Cleaner process**: No more "Customer is required" errors when adding users
- **Simplified workflow**: System handles all cleanup automatically (user roles, settings, database records)

**Why this helps**: Administrators can add and remove users without unexpected errors or delays. The system now properly cleans up all user-related data when a user is removed.

#### Simplified Part Number Management

**What's fixed**:
- **Only 2 required fields**: When adding new parts, you only need to enter **Part Number** and **Item Type** (was requiring Customer and Description unnecessarily)
- **Item Type defaults to "WIP"**: The most common choice is pre-selected for you
- **Optional fields work properly**: Customer, Description, and other fields can be left blank if not needed

**What's better**:
- **Faster part entry**: Enter new parts in seconds without filling unnecessary fields
- **Less frustration**: No more "Customer is required" or "Description is required" error messages
- **Matches your workflow**: Most parts don't need customer or detailed descriptions right away

**How to use**:
1. Click **Settings** → **Part Numbers** → **Add Part Number**
2. Enter the **Part Number** (e.g., "12345-A")
3. Select **Item Type** from dropdown (defaults to "WIP" - most common choice)
4. Click **Save** - That's it!
5. *Optional*: Fill in Customer, Description if you want to add more details

**Example workflow**:
- Adding a new WIP part: Just type part number and click Save (Item Type already set to WIP)
- Adding a finished goods part: Type part number, change Item Type to "FG", click Save
- Adding a purchased part with details: Type part number, select Item Type, fill in Customer and Description, click Save

**Why this helps**:
- **3x faster data entry** - most parts are WIP and don't need extra details
- **Fewer mistakes** - less typing means fewer typos
- **Matches how you work** - add basic info fast, update details later if needed

---

## Previous Update - November 2, 2025 (Version 5.9.0)

**What Changed**: User Management, Part Number Management, and Settings Form improvements

**Performance Improvements**:
- **3x faster search**: Old interface took 5-8 seconds for large searches, new one completes in under 2 seconds
- **Instant page navigation**: Switching between pages happens immediately (was 1-2 second delay)
- **Handles huge datasets**: Search 100,000+ transactions without freezing or slowing down
- **Responsive grid**: Scrolling and sorting work smoothly even with complex filters

**Why this helps**:
- **Save time**: Find specific transactions in seconds instead of minutes
- **Less clicking**: Everything visible on one screen - no jumping between windows
- **Better troubleshooting**: More filter combinations help pinpoint exactly what you're looking for
- **Easier tracking**: See transaction details while keeping search results visible
- **Reduced errors**: Clear layout prevents confusion about which transaction you're viewing

#### Transaction Analytics Summary (NEW!)

**What's New**:
- **Real-time statistics** displayed above the search results
- **Summary cards** show totals for current date range:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

## Update - October 26, 2025 (Version 5.3.3)

**What Changed**: New error reporting feature  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - but you can now help us fix problems faster!

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Help Us Fix Problems Faster

**New "Report Issue" button** in error messages:
- When something goes wrong, you'll see a **"Report Issue"** button
- Click it to tell us what you were doing when the error happened
- Just type a quick note like "I was trying to transfer part #12345 to location B"
- Your report gets a tracking number so we can follow up with you

**Why this helps**: We can fix problems faster because we know exactly what you were doing when things went wrong.

#### Works Even When Network is Down

**Don't worry about losing reports**:
- If the network is down, your report is saved locally
- When the network comes back, reports are sent automatically
- You'll never lose a report due to network issues

**What you'll see**: If network is down, you'll see a message like "Report saved and will be sent when connection is restored"

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

## Update - October 25, 2025 (Version 5.3.2)

**What Changed**: Better error tracking with computer names  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - automatic improvement

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Automatic Computer Name Tracking

**What's new** (added October 25, 2025):
- When you submit an error report, the system now automatically records which computer you're using
- Shows the actual computer name (like "SHOP-PC-01" or "OFFICE-LAPTOP-05")
- This happens automatically in the background - you don't need to do anything

**Why this helps**:
- **IT can troubleshoot faster**: If your computer is having issues, IT can see your computer name in the error report
- **Identify problem machines**: If one computer has repeated issues, IT can swap it out or investigate hardware problems
- **Better support**: When you call IT for help, they can pull up all error reports from your specific computer

**What you'll see**:
- Nothing different when submitting reports - it still works exactly the same way
- If IT asks you about an error, they might now say "I see you had this error on SHOP-PC-01" instead of just asking "which computer were you on?"

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Update - October 25, 2025 (Version 5.3.1)

**What Changed**: Display scaling improvements  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - just click "Restart" when prompted if you move between monitors

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Better Display on Different Monitors and Screen Scaling

**If you use multiple monitors**, move your laptop between different displays, **or change your Windows screen scale** (100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%):
- The application now **asks before automatically resizing** when display scaling changes
- You'll see a clear message like: "Display changed from 100% to 150%"
- You can choose what happens:
  - **Restart Now** (recommended) - Cleanest, fastest option - everything looks perfect
  - **Auto-Resize** - Immediate but windows may look weird temporarily
  - **Cancel** - Keep using as-is

**When does this happen?**
- Moving windows between monitors with different scaling settings
- Docking/undocking your laptop
- Changing Windows Display Settings → Scale (System > Display > Scale in Windows Settings)

**Why this helps**: No more surprise layout changes or stretched windows. You stay in control of when the app adjusts to your display changes.

#### Error Messages Look Right Now

**What was wrong**: Error dialogs were too large on some monitors (especially 4K displays and laptops with high-resolution screens)

**What's fixed**: Error messages now appear at the right size on all screens - no more giant dialogs that extend off-screen

**What you'll notice**: When errors happen, the message fits nicely on your screen with all buttons visible and clickable

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Update - October 17-21, 2025 (Version 5.1.0)

**What Changed**: Database layer modernization - comprehensive refactoring  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - internal improvements only

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Modernized Database Architecture

**Major behind-the-scenes overhaul completed**:
- **60+ stored procedures standardized** with consistent error handling
- **12 Data Access Objects (DAOs) refactored** for reliability
- **220+ database call sites updated** to modern async patterns
- **Transaction management improved** for data integrity

**What this prevents**:
- MySQL parameter errors that caused confusing error messages
- Data corruption from incomplete multi-step operations
- Application crashes during database connectivity issues
- Inconsistent behavior across different features

**Improved error handling**:
- **Graceful connection failures**: If database becomes unavailable, you'll see "Connection lost. Retry?" instead of crashes
- **Better error messages**: Clear, actionable messages instead of cryptic MySQL errors
- **Automatic retries**: Transient network issues handled automatically
- **Data protection**: All multi-step operations (transfers, adjustments) now use transactions - either all steps succeed or all rollback

**For IT Support and Developers**:
- **Developer Tools Suite** added to Settings menu
  - Debug Dashboard for real-time application monitoring
  - Parameter Prefix Maintenance for stored procedure management
  - Schema Inspector for database structure review
  - Code Generator for DAO method creation
  - Procedure Call Hierarchy visualization
- **Developer Role** introduced (requires Admin + Developer privileges)
- **Comprehensive logging** with method names, parameters, and call stacks
- **Performance monitoring** with configurable slow query thresholds:
  - Queries: 500ms
  - Modifications: 1000ms
  - Reports: 2000ms
  - Batch operations: 5000ms

**Infrastructure improvements**:
- **Test database**: `mtm_wip_application_winform_test` for isolated integration testing
- **Transaction support**: All DAO methods now support external transactions
- **Connection pooling**: Configured for 5-100 connections for optimal performance
- **Parameter detection**: Automatic INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries at startup for accurate parameter mapping

**Why you won't notice much**:
- This was all internal plumbing work
- Operations work the same way they always have
- But now they're more reliable, faster to fix, and better documented
- Foundation laid for future feature development

### 📱 Common Questions

**Q: Why wasn't my theme saving before?**  
A: The code was calling a stored procedure that doesn't exist (`usr_settings_Upsert`). Now it uses the correct procedure (`usr_settings_SetThemeJson`) that properly merges your theme choice into your settings.

**Q: Will changing my theme affect other users?**  
A: No - themes are per-user. Your theme choice only affects your login, not anyone else's.

**Q: What happens to my other settings when I change themes?**  
A: Nothing - theme changes only update your `Theme_Name` setting. All your other preferences (grid column settings, shortcuts, etc.) remain unchanged.

**Q: Can I go back to the default theme?**  
A: Yes - just select "Default" from the theme dropdown and click Save.

**Q: Why does the app still show Lavender after I picked a different theme?**  
A: If you're on version 6.0.1 or earlier, the save function is broken. Update to 6.0.2 and your theme selection will save correctly.

**Q: Do themes change the layout or just the colors?**  
A: Themes only change colors and visual styling. The layout, buttons, and functionality remain exactly the same regardless of theme choice.

**Q: How do I know if I have duplicate QuickButtons?**  
A: If you see the same Part Number + Operation combination appearing more than once in your QuickButtons panel, you have duplicates. Update to version 6.0.1 and they'll be cleaned up automatically on next restart.

**Q: Why were my QuickButtons showing raw codes instead of descriptions?**  
A: This was a bug in how the buttons filled the dropdown fields. Version 6.0.1 fixes this - now they use proper value selection instead of text search.

**Q: How do I edit a QuickButton?**  
A: Right-click any QuickButton and select "Edit" from the menu. You can change the Part ID, Operation, or Quantity. Click OK to save changes.

**Q: Can I reorder my QuickButtons?**  
A: Yes! Right-click any QuickButton and select "Change Order". Drag and drop rows to rearrange them, or use Shift+Up/Down arrow keys to move selected rows. Click OK to save the new order.

**Q: Why do my newest QuickButtons appear at the top now?**  
A: This is the new intended behavior - most users want their most recent transactions at the top for quick access. Older transactions shift down automatically.

**Q: What happens to my existing QuickButtons after this update?**  
A: All your existing buttons remain unchanged. Duplicates are removed automatically on first load after update. Order stays the same unless you manually reorder them.

**Q: Will the Transaction Viewer look completely different?**  
A: Yes - the layout is much cleaner and more modern. Search filters at top, results on left, details on right. But all the same information is there, just better organized and faster to access.

**Q: Can I still search the old way?**  
A: The old interface has been completely replaced with the new one, but all your usual searches work the same or better. The new interface has more filter options and is faster.

**Q: Where did my transaction history go?**  
A: All 24,000+ historical transactions are still there and fully searchable. Nothing was deleted or changed - just the viewing interface is new.

**Q: How do I search for transactions from a specific part?**  
A: Click the Part Number dropdown at the top, start typing the part number (it autocompletes), select it, then click Search. You'll see all transactions for that part.

**Q: Can I search by multiple filters at once?**  
A: Yes! Fill in any combination of filters - Part Number, User, Locations, Operation, Date Range, Transaction Type, and Notes. All filters work together (AND logic).

**Q: What does the page jump feature do?**  
A: If you have 20 pages of results, you can type "15" in the page box and click Go to jump directly to page 15. Much faster than clicking Next 14 times.

**Q: How fast is the new search?**  
A: Most searches complete in under 2 seconds, even when searching 90 days of history. Large result sets (1000+ transactions) use pagination so the screen loads instantly.

**Q: Can I sort the results?**  
A: Yes! Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.

**Q: What are the analytics cards at the top?**  
A: Those show real-time summaries of your current search: total transactions, total IN, total OUT, and total TRANSFER counts. They update automatically when you change your date range.

**Q: Why does it only show 50 transactions at a time?**  
A: Pagination keeps the interface fast and responsive. You can navigate through all results using the Previous/Next buttons or page jump. Total count is always displayed.

**Q: Can I change the page size to show more or fewer transactions?**  
A: The default is 50 per page. Contact IT if you need to adjust this setting for your workstation.

**Q: What's a "Transaction Lifecycle"?**  
A: (Coming next release) It's a visual timeline showing what happened to a batch of parts from start to finish. Example: 500 units came IN at Location A, then 250 were TRANSFERred to Location B, then 100 more moved to Location C. The tree view shows all these movements chronologically.

**Q: Why do I need to see batch splits?**  
A: (Coming next release) When tracking down inventory discrepancies or verifying transfers, seeing the complete history of where units went helps find issues faster. No more guessing which transactions are related to each other.

**Q: Will I lose my work when the app restarts for display changes?**  
A: Yes

**Q: How do I change my Windows screen scale?**

# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Relevant Instruction Files

**Note**: These instruction files provide coding patterns and standards for implementation. Review relevant files when moving from planning to task execution.

### Core Development:
- `.github/instructions/csharp-dotnet8.instructions.md` - Language features, WinForms patterns, async/await, file organization
- `.github/instructions/mysql-database.instructions.md` - Stored procedures, connection management, Helper_Database_StoredProcedure usage
- `.github/instructions/documentation.instructions.md` - XML comments, README structure, code documentation

### Quality & Security:
- `.github/instructions/testing-standards.instructions.md` - Manual validation approach, success criteria, test scenarios
- `.github/instructions/integration-testing.instructions.md` - Discovery-first workflow, method signature verification, DAO testing patterns
- `.github/instructions/security-best-practices.instructions.md` - Input validation, credential management, SQL injection prevention
- `.github/instructions/performance-optimization.instructions.md` - Async patterns, connection pooling, memory management, caching strategies
- `.github/instructions/code-review-standards.instructions.md` - Quality gates, review process, common issues

### When to Use:
- **During task generation** (`/speckit.tasks`): Reference to add instruction file pointers to specific tasks
- **During implementation** (`/speckit.implement`): Load instruction files to apply correct patterns
- **During code review**: Validate compliance with documented standards

**Instruction File Reference Format in Tasks**:
```markdown
- [ ] T100 - Implement DAO method for inventory queries
  - **Reference**: .github/instructions/mysql-database.instructions.md - Use Helper_Database_StoredProcedure pattern
  - **Reference**: .github/instructions/csharp-dotnet8.instructions.md - Follow async/await patterns
```

Connections	2929	The number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server.
Created tmp disk tables	13461	The number of temporary tables on disk created automatically by the server while executing statements. If Created_tmp_disk_tables is big, you may want to increase the tmp_table_size value to cause temporary tables to be memory-based instead of disk-based.
Created tmp files	3413	How many temporary files mysqld has created.
Created tmp tables	62385	The number of in-memory temporary tables created automatically by the server while executing statements.
Delayed errors	0	The number of rows written with INSERT DELAYED for which some error occurred (probably duplicate key).
Delayed insert threads	0	The number of INSERT DELAYED handler threads in use. Every different table on which one uses INSERT DELAYED gets its own thread.
Delayed writes	0	The number of INSERT DELAYED rows written.
Flush commands	1	The number of executed FLUSH statements.
Handler commit	169311	The number of internal COMMIT statements.
Handler delete	3284	The number of times a row was deleted from a table.
Handler discover	0	The MySQL server can ask the NDB Cluster storage engine if it knows about a table with a given name. This is called discovery. Handler_discover indicates the number of time tables have been discovered.
Handler external lock	402085	
Handler mrr init	0	
Handler prepare	0	
Handler read first	121297	The number of times the first entry was read from an index. If this is high, it suggests that the server is doing a lot of full index scans; for example, SELECT col1 FROM foo, assuming that col1 is indexed.
Handler read key	11619126	The number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this is high, it is a good indication that your queries and tables are properly indexed.
Handler read last	1225	
Handler read next	7031383	The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This is incremented if you are querying an index column with a range constraint or if you are doing an index scan.
Handler read prev	2	The number of requests to read the previous row in key order. This read method is mainly used to optimize ORDER BY … DESC.
Handler read rnd	11278870	The number of requests to read a row based on a fixed position. This is high if you are doing a lot of queries that require sorting of the result. You probably have a lot of queries that require MySQL to scan whole tables or you have joins that don't use keys properly.
Handler read rnd next	29121408	The number of requests to read the next row in the data file. This is high if you are doing a lot of table scans. Generally this suggests that your tables are not properly indexed or that your queries are not written to take advantage of the indexes you have.
Handler rollback	0	The number of internal ROLLBACK statements.
Handler savepoint	0	
Handler savepoint rollback	0	
Handler update	1381	The number of requests to update a row in a table.
Handler write	2160579	The number of requests to insert a row in a table.

Innodb buffer pool pages misc	71	The number of pages busy because they have been allocated for administrative overhead such as row locks or the adaptive hash index. This value can also be calculated as Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_total - Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free - Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data.
Innodb buffer pool pages total	8192	Total size of buffer pool, in pages.

Innodb buffer pool reads	1676	The number of logical reads that InnoDB could not satisfy from buffer pool and had to do a single-page read.
Innodb buffer pool wait free	0	Normally, writes to the InnoDB buffer pool happen in the background. However, if it's necessary to read or create a page and no clean pages are available, it's necessary to wait for pages to be flushed first. This counter counts instances of these waits. If the buffer pool size was set properly, this value should be small.
Innodb buffer pool write requests	11955160	The number writes done to the InnoDB buffer pool.

Key read requests	1999262	The number of requests to read a key block from the cache.
Key reads	81	The number of physical reads of a key block from disk. If Key_reads is big, then your key_buffer_size value is probably too small. The cache miss rate can be calculated as Key_reads/Key_read_requests.
Key write requests	0	The number of requests to write a key block to the cache.

Table locks immediate	28854	The number of times that a table lock was acquired immediately.
Table locks waited	0	The number of times that a table lock could not be acquired immediately and a wait was needed. If this is high, and you have performance problems, you should first optimize your queries, and then either split your table or tables or use replication.

Threads connected	80	The number of currently open connections.
Threads created	1172	The number of threads created to handle connections. If Threads_created is big, you may want to increase the thread_cache_size value. (Normally this doesn't give a notable performance improvement if you have a good thread implementation.)

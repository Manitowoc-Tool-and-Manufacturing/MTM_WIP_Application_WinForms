1) in PartID - Edit, when i first enter a fully matching part in the suggestiontextboxwithlabel (did not have to access the suggestion overlay) then (without resetting) go back into the select partid suggestiontextboxwithlabel and enter a partial partnumber here is what happens (from the very biginning)
  1a) Open Part ID Management
  1b) Click "Edit Part Number"
  1c) Enter a full part number (21-28841-006) into the Part Number SuggestionTextBox, because it is an accurate match the suggestionoverlay does not appear - normal behavior
  1d) I then go back into the SuggestionTextBox, enter a partial Number (28841) , hit tab, suggestion overlay appears
  1e) I select the same part id i had previously selected (21-28841-006)
  PROBLEM) Application completely freezes

  NOTE: This ONLY happens so far in PartID - Edit, i tried replicating the same pattern in other forms that use suggetrsiontextboxwithoverly and they all worked as expected

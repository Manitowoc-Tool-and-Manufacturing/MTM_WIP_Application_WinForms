### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Settings Form Now Works for All Users - Was broken during implementation of Stored Procedure fix, finally getting to it now.

**What's fixed**:
- **Settings form no longer crashes when opening**: Opening Settings → Database, Theme, or other settings now works reliably for all users in all environments
- **Fixed database connection switching issue**: The application no longer tries to switch to unreachable servers when loading saved settings (was causing "Unable to connect to MySQL host" errors)
- **Environment-aware server selection**: In development/test mode, the app stays connected to localhost even if saved settings mention a production server
- **Fresh database support**: The application handles empty settings tables gracefully (important for test environments and new installations)
- **Better error recovery**: If settings can't be loaded, the form displays default values instead of crashing

**Why this broke before**:
- When opening Settings form, it loaded saved database connection preferences
- If those preferences contained a production server address (172.16.1.104), the app tried to switch to it
- In test/development environments running on localhost, this caused connection failures and error spam
- Multiple stored procedures failed trying to reach the unreachable production server

**What's better now**:
- Test/development environments stay connected to localhost regardless of saved settings
- Production environments still work normally with saved server preferences
- Server address changes are validated before being applied
- First-time users see sensible defaults (localhost in dev, production server in release builds)
- Settings form loads instantly even with no saved preferences
- Makes testing and new installations smoother

**How this helps**: 
- Developers and testers can open Settings form without triggering connection errors
- New employees, test environments, and fresh database setups work without manual database setup
- Production users are unaffected - their saved settings work as expected
- The Settings form "just works" in all environments from day one

---

#### Easier User Management (For Administrators)

**What's fixed**:
- **Faster user deletion**: Removing users from the system now completes in 2-3 seconds (was freezing at 10%)
- **Cleaner process**: No more "Customer is required" errors when adding users
- **Simplified workflow**: System handles all cleanup automatically (user roles, settings, database records)

**Why this helps**: Administrators can add and remove users without unexpected errors or delays. The system now properly cleans up all user-related data when a user is removed.

#### Simplified Part Number Management

**What's fixed**:
- **Only 2 required fields**: When adding new parts, you only need to enter **Part Number** and **Item Type** (was requiring Customer and Description unnecessarily)
- **Item Type defaults to "WIP"**: The most common choice is pre-selected for you
- **Optional fields work properly**: Customer, Description, and other fields can be left blank if not needed

**What's better**:
- **Faster part entry**: Enter new parts in seconds without filling unnecessary fields
- **Less frustration**: No more "Customer is required" or "Description is required" error messages
- **Matches your workflow**: Most parts don't need customer or detailed descriptions right away

**How to use**:
1. Click **Settings** → **Part Numbers** → **Add Part Number**
2. Enter the **Part Number** (e.g., "12345-A")
3. Select **Item Type** from dropdown (defaults to "WIP" - most common choice)
4. Click **Save** - That's it!
5. *Optional*: Fill in Customer, Description if you want to add more details

**Example workflow**:
- Adding a new WIP part: Just type part number and click Save (Item Type already set to WIP)
- Adding a finished goods part: Type part number, change Item Type to "FG", click Save
- Adding a purchased part with details: Type part number, select Item Type, fill in Customer and Description, click Save

**Why this helps**:
- **3x faster data entry** - most parts are WIP and don't need extra details
- **Fewer mistakes** - less typing means fewer typos
- **Matches how you work** - add basic info fast, update details later if needed

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Settings Form Now Works for All Users - Was broken during implementation of Stored Procedure fix, finally getting to it now.

**What's New**:
- **Modern 3-panel layout**: Search filters at top, results grid on left, transaction details on right - see everything at once
- **Lightning fast searches**: Find transactions in under 2 seconds, even when searching 90 days of history with thousands of records
- **Advanced filtering**: Search by Part Number, User, From Location, To Location, Operation, Date Range, Transaction Type (IN/OUT/TRANSFER), and Notes keywords
- **Smart pagination**: Navigate large result sets with Previous/Next buttons, page jump (go directly to page 5 of 20), and clear "Page X of Y" display
- **Instant detail view**: Click any transaction row to see complete information on the right - no popup windows
- **Remembers your last search**: Filters stay filled when you come back, making repeated searches faster
- **Configurable page size**: Default 50 transactions per page (adjustable in settings)

**How to use**:
1. Click **Transactions** tab from main menu (same location as before)
2. **Fill in search filters** at the top (all filters are optional - use what you need):
   - **Part Number**: Dropdown with autocomplete (type to search your parts)
   - **User**: Select any user (admins see all users, regular users see only themselves)
   - **From Location**: Where the inventory came from
   - **To Location**: Where the inventory went to
   - **Operation**: Manufacturing step (90, 100, 110, 120, 130, etc.)
   - **Transaction Type**: Check IN, OUT, or TRANSFER (or all three)
   - **Date Range**: Quick buttons (Today/This Week/This Month) or custom From/To dates
   - **Notes**: Search for keywords in transaction notes
3. Click **Search** button (or press Enter)
4. **View results** in the grid on left:
   - Shows: ID, Type, Part Number, Quantity, From→To locations, User, Date/Time
   - Sort by any column (click column header)
   - 50 transactions per page
5. **Click any row** to see full details on the right:

## Previous Update - October 26, 2025 (Version 5.3.1)

**What Changed**: Display scaling improvements  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - just click "Restart" when prompted if you move between monitors

---

### 🎯 What This Means For You

#### Better Display on Different Monitors and Screen Scaling

**If you use multiple monitors**, move your laptop between different displays, **or change your Windows screen scale** (100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%):
- The application now **asks before automatically resizing** when display scaling changes
- You'll see a clear message like: "Display changed from 100% to 150%"
- You can choose what happens:
  - **Restart Now** (recommended) - Cleanest, fastest option - everything looks perfect
  - **Auto-Resize** - Immediate but windows may look weird temporarily
  - **Cancel** - Keep using as-is

**When does this happen?**
- Moving windows between monitors with different scaling settings
- Docking/undocking your laptop
- Changing Windows Display Settings → Scale (System > Display > Scale in Windows Settings)

**Why this helps**: No more surprise layout changes or stretched windows. You stay in control of when the app adjusts to your display changes.

#### Error Messages Look Right Now

**What was wrong**: Error dialogs were too large on some monitors (especially 4K displays and laptops with high-resolution screens)

**What's fixed**: Error messages now appear at the right size on all screens - no more giant dialogs that extend off-screen

**What you'll notice**: When errors happen, the message fits nicely on your screen with all buttons visible and clickable

---

**What Changed**: New error reporting feature  
**Do I Need To Do Anything?**: No - but you can now help us fix problems faster!

**New "Report Issue" button** in error messages:
- When something goes wrong, you'll see a **"Report Issue"** button
- Click it to tell us what you were doing when the error happened
- Just type a quick note like "I was trying to transfer part #12345 to location B"
- Your report gets a tracking number so we can follow up with you

**Why this helps**: We can fix problems faster because we know exactly what you were doing when things went wrong.

#### Works Even When Network is Down

**Don't worry about losing reports**:
- If the network is down, your report is saved locally
- When the network comes back, reports are sent automatically
- You'll never lose a report due to network issues

**What you'll see**: If network is down, you'll see a message like "Report saved and will be sent when connection is restored"

### 📱 Common Questions

**Q: Will the Transaction Viewer look completely different?**  
A: Yes - the layout is much cleaner and more modern. Search filters at top, results on left, details on right. But all the same information is there, just better organized and faster to access.

**Q: Can I still search the old way?**  
A: The old interface has been completely replaced with the new one, but all your usual searches work the same or better. The new interface has more filter options and is faster.

**Q: Where did my transaction history go?**  
A: All 24,000+ historical transactions are still there and fully searchable. Nothing was deleted or changed - just the viewing interface is new.

**Q: How do I search for transactions from a specific part?**  
A: Click the Part Number dropdown at the top, start typing the part number (it autocompletes), select it, then click Search. You'll see all transactions for that part.

**Q: Can I search by multiple filters at once?**  
A: Yes! Fill in any combination of filters - Part Number, User, Locations, Operation, Date Range, Transaction Type, and Notes. All filters work together (AND logic).

**Q: What does the page jump feature do?**  
A: If you have 20 pages of results, you can type "15" in the page box and click Go to jump directly to page 15. Much faster than clicking Next 14 times.

**Q: How fast is the new search?**  
A: Most searches complete in under 2 seconds, even when searching 90 days of history. Large result sets (1000+ transactions) use pagination so the screen loads instantly.

**Q: Can I sort the results?**  
A: Yes! Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the sort order.

**Q: What are the analytics cards at the top?**  
A: Those show real-time summaries of your current search: total transactions, total IN, total OUT, and total TRANSFER counts. They update automatically when you change your date range.

**Q: Why does it only show 50 transactions at a time?**  
A: Pagination keeps the interface fast and responsive. You can navigate through all results using the Previous/Next buttons or page jump. Total count is always displayed.

**Q: Can I change the page size to show more or fewer transactions?**  
A: The default is 50 per page. Contact IT if you need to adjust this setting for your workstation.

**Q: What's a "Transaction Lifecycle"?**  
A: (Coming next release) It's a visual timeline showing what happened to a batch of parts from start to finish. Example: 500 units came IN at Location A, then 250 were TRANSFERred to Location B, then 100 more moved to Location C. The tree view shows all these movements chronologically.

**Q: Why do I need to see batch splits?**  
A: (Coming next release) When tracking down inventory discrepancies or verifying transfers, seeing the complete history of where units went helps find issues faster. No more guessing which transactions are related to each other.

**Q: Will I lose my work when the app restarts for display changes?**  
A: No - the application saves your current state and restarts instantly

**Q: How do I change my Windows screen scale?**  
A: Go to Windows Settings → System → Display → Scale. You can choose 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, or 200%. The app will prompt you to restart after you change this setting.

**Q: Do I have to submit error reports?**  
A: No, it's optional - but it helps us fix problems faster if you do

**Q: What information is sent in error reports?**  
A: Your username, what you were doing (if you tell us), the error details, and the date/time. No personal information or production data is sent.

**Q: Can I see my submitted reports?**  
A: Yes - Contact John Koll at (ext. 323) or jkoll@mantoolmfg.com / Dan Smith at (ext. 311) or dsmith@mantoolmfg.com / Ka Lee at (ext. ___ ) or klee@mantoolmfg.com and provide your Report ID number

**Q: What if I submit a report by accident?**  
A: No problem - Contact John Koll at (ext. 323) or jkoll@mantoolmfg.com / Dan Smith at (ext. 311) or dsmith@mantoolmfg.com / Ka Lee at (ext. ___ ) or klee@mantoolmfg.com

# Code Review Standards

## Available MCP Tools for Code Review

When performing code reviews, use these MCP tools from the **mtm-workflow** server:
- `validate_dao_patterns` - Check DAO compliance with MTM patterns
- `validate_error_handling` - Verify error handling correctness
- `check_security` - Scan for security vulnerabilities
- `analyze_performance` - Identify performance bottlenecks
- `check_xml_docs` - Verify documentation coverage
- `suggest_refactoring` - Get AI-powered refactoring suggestions
- `analyze_stored_procedures` - Validate stored procedure compliance
- `analyze_dependencies` - Visualize stored procedure call chains when reviewing cross-procedure changes.
- `compare_databases` - Highlight schema drift between baseline and proposed SQL updates.
- `validate_schema` - Confirm live schemas match the expected snapshot before approving database migrations.
- `generate_ui_fix_plan` & `validate_ui_scaling` - Assess UI-related diffs for DPI/scaling regressions.

## Overview

This file defines code review standards, checklists, and quality gates for the MTM WIP Application to ensure consistent code quality and adherence to MTM patterns.

## Core Principles

### Code Review Goals
- Ensure pattern compliance
- Catch bugs before production
- Share knowledge across team
- Maintain code quality standards
- Improve code readability

### Constructive Feedback
- Focus on code, not the person
- Explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Offer alternatives when critiquing
- Acknowledge good code
- Be respectful and professional

## General Code Quality Checklist

### Readability
- [ ] Code is easy to read and understand
- [ ] Variable and method names are descriptive
- [ ] Code follows consistent formatting
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity

### Correctness
- [ ] Code solves the intended problem
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logical errors
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] null checks where necessary

### Maintainability
- [ ] Code follows SOLID principles
- [ ] Methods are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] DRY principle followed (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Code is testable

## C# and .NET 8 Compliance

### Language Features
- [ ] Uses C# 12 features where they improve clarity without breaking designer support
- [ ] File-scoped namespaces adopted for new files
- [ ] Nullable reference annotations respected (no ignored warnings)
- [ ] Pattern matching used for complex branching when it improves readability
- [ ] `readonly` fields and `sealed` classes considered when extension is not required

### Async/Await
- [ ] Long-running or I/O heavy work is asynchronous
- [ ] No `.Result`, `.Wait()`, or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on the UI thread
- [ ] Async method names end with `Async`
- [ ] UI updates after awaits marshal onto the WinForms synchronization context
- [ ] Cancellation tokens supported when operations can be interrupted by the user

### WinForms Structure
- [ ] Event handlers remain short and delegate to helper/DAO/service methods
- [ ] No logic added to `.Designer.cs` files; partial classes keep designer compatibility
- [ ] Shared UI logic pulled into reusable controls or helper classes instead of copy/paste
- [ ] Background operations use `Task.Run`, `BackgroundWorker`, or timers with safe marshaling back to the UI
- [ ] Resource cleanup performed in `Dispose`, `FormClosing`, or explicit helper methods as appropriate

## Database Compliance

### Stored Procedures
- [ ] All operations use stored procedures
- [ ] Helper_Database_StoredProcedure.ExecuteDataTableWithStatus used
- [ ] Parameters passed via Dictionary<string, object>
- [ ] Status and error return values handled
- [ ] No inline SQL (except simple queries if justified)

### Connection Management
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration correct
- [ ] Connections disposed properly with using statements
- [ ] Connection strings from configuration, not hardcoded
- [ ] Timeout values appropriate (30 seconds default)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Database errors logged appropriately
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Transactions used when appropriate

## Security Compliance

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user input validated
- [ ] Parameterized queries used
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validation errors displayed to user

### Sensitive Data
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Connection strings secured
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal internals

### Authentication/Authorization
- [ ] User permissions checked appropriately
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Manufacturing operations authorized

## Performance Compliance

### Async Operations
- [ ] I/O operations are async
- [ ] UI thread not blocked
- [ ] Parallel operations used when appropriate
- [ ] Task.WhenAll for multiple async operations

### Database Performance
- [ ] Queries optimized
- [ ] Appropriate indexes used
- [ ] Result sets limited when appropriate
- [ ] Connection pooling utilized

### Memory Management
- [ ] IDisposable resources disposed
- [ ] No obvious memory leaks
- [ ] ObservableCollections sized appropriately
- [ ] Large objects cleared when not needed

## Testing Compliance

### Testability
- [ ] Code is written to be testable (logic separated from UI where reasonable)
- [ ] Shared logic lives in helpers/services rather than inside forms
- [ ] Methods remain focused and single-purpose
- [ ] Database work encapsulated in DAOs for easier verification

### Manual Validation
- [ ] Success criteria defined
- [ ] Feature tested manually
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Cross-platform testing done where applicable

## Documentation Compliance

### XML Comments
- [ ] Public APIs have XML documentation
- [ ] Summary tags present and clear
- [ ] Parameter and return tags included
- [ ] Exception tags for thrown exceptions
- [ ] Remarks tag for additional context

### Code Comments
- [ ] Non-obvious logic explained
- [ ] Complex algorithms documented
- [ ] Business rules clarified
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] TODO comments tracked

## Manufacturing Domain Compliance

### Operations Validation
- [ ] Operations validated against ValidOperations config
- [ ] Transaction types (IN/OUT/TRANSFER) used correctly
- [ ] Location codes validated against DefaultLocations
- [ ] Work order operations understood as sequence steps

### Session Management
- [ ] Session timeout respected (60 minutes)
- [ ] Quick buttons limited to 10 per user

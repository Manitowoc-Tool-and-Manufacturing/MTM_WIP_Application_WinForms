read #file:Control_TransferTab.cs and refactor the way i
implemented the setting for EnableAnimations as i believe
its too complex. then using that new method implent validation
in #file:Control_InventoryTab.cs (also the quickbutton arrows
are backwards in this control) #file:Control_RemoveTab.cs
(arrow directions are fine here for both buttons,
just implement the validation) #file:Control_AdvancedInventory.cs
I just added 5 buttons to this control and there prefixes are
_InputToggle and _QuickButtonToggle (2 in tab 1, 2 in tab 2 and 1 in tab 3))
you will need to implement animation logic, animation setting validation logic,
panel collapse logic for tab 1 and 2's input panels as well as the quickbutton
toggle button in all 3 tabs as well. lastly you will need to do validation
logic in #file:Control_AdvancedRemove.cs as well as implement quickbutton
panel collapse / expand logic for the new _QuickButtonToggle button I placed
in #file:Control_AdvancedRemove.cs as well as animation / validation logic.
note in case i missed it: ALL 32 X 32 BUTTONS in the mentioned controls
REQUIRE Animation Logic / Animation Validation Logic (setting that turns
it on and off in #file:Model_Shared_Users.cs ) / ALL 32 X 32 BUTTONS MUST
HAVE SOME KIND OF COLLAPSE/EXPAND LOGIC.
